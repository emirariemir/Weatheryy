# Weatheryy
I made a weather app for learning about the API calls in Swift. With this simple project, I learned a few concepts:
1. Making an API call and decode the data with `Decodable` objects
2. `extensions` and `protocols` in Swift
3. Handling the colors in Dark and Light modes by creating **Color Packs**
4. Working with vector images
5. **The Delegate Design Pattern** that Apple loves.

## How important that is?
Well, it is pretty much *just a weather app*. Typing out a city name on my beautiful `UITextField` and seeing what the weather is like there might not sound interesting. But throughout the journey (3 days) I learned a lot (basically was a StackOverflow hunt). And I'm not only talking about the concepts, I also learned about not giving up on your little projects (I cried 6 times). Little projects are the best, the world would be pointless without little projects (I need a job).
